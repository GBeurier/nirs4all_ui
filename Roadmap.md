# TODO

[Layout]
- Run id history


[Workspace]
- source combobox in dataset edit is useless
- refresh button per dataset
- link to page from recap
- Verify add datasets with files (backend side maybe)

[Pipeline]

- Order menus better and set a category for experimental, and rare operators. Hide advanced button
- add a Chart category and an Analysis category
- move nirs4all models and standard models in a dedicated category
- Manage generation operators.
- add name to operators
- remove input shape in NN (it's hidden)
- Add info on classifier or regressor
- verify box size or trim long text
- DO NOT SAVE DEFAULT PARAMS
- Activate / Deactivate nodes
- new menu with opened pipelines
- pipeline name
- important params directly in the node div
- generator nodes with actions directly in pipeline editor

[Pipeline operators]
- add iterstrat splitters: MultilabelStratifiedKFold, MultilabelStratifiedShuffleSplit and sklearn StratifiedGroupKFold, etc.

[Predictions]
- Create views (either different prediction sources, or filters); allows to link a pipeline to its own predictions only
- View accessibles in a menu.
- Find a way to handle multiples predictions (either multi windows, temp groups, I don't fucking now how)
- reduce filters size combo and button and dates
- add many other filters and sorts
- led to signal pipeline saved or not

[Predictions_run]
- same as db but for last run


[Distribution]
- nirs4all icon on exe
- How to embed python library (automate git pull + pip install)
- How to update (git pull ???) + update available detection (pip detect on startup + update on popup or restart)
- How to package the install ?



# PERSPECTIVES

[Webpage]
- what is needed to replace workspace ??
- how to manage server ressources
- auth
